Spring: |+2
  <br/>
  Update your application.yaml with the additional code below. (Only the relevant portions are included.).

  If you rely on Spring to autodiscover the entities which are placed in the same package/sub-package as the application class with @SpringBootApplication annotation, you will have to add the @EntityScan annotation to that application class for those entities to be discovered after async is enabled.

  ```yaml
  elide:
    async:
      enabled: true
      cleanupEnabled: true
  ```

Elide Standalone: |+2
  <br/>
  Update your implementation of [ElideStandaloneSettings](https://github.com/yahoo/elide/blob/master/elide-standalone/src/main/java/com/yahoo/elide/standalone/config/ElideStandaloneSettings.java) interface with the below mentioned additional code. (Only the relevant portions are included.)

  ```java
  @Override
  public ElideStandaloneAsyncSettings getAsyncProperties() {
      ElideStandaloneAsyncSettings asyncProperties = new ElideStandaloneAsyncSettings() {
          @Override
          public boolean enabled() {
              return true;
          }

          @Override
          public boolean enableCleanup() {
              return true;
          }
      }
      return asyncProperties;
  }
  ```
